    <h1>Types of Bicycles</h1>
    <p>The bicycle has undergone continual adaptation and improvement since its inception.<br>
        These innovations have continued with the advent of modern materials and computer-aided design,<br>
        allowing for a proliferation of specialized bicycle types, improved bicycle safety, and riding comfort.</p>

        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Road</h3>
            <p>The term road bicycle is used to describe bicycles built for traveling at speed on paved roads.<br>
                they usually have more gear combinations and fewer hi-tech racing features.<br>
                Certain of these bicycles have been referred to as 'sportive' bicycles to distinguish them from racing bicycles<br>

        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Mountain</h3>
            <p>A mountain bike is a bicycle designed for off-road cycling.<br>
                Mountain bikes incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain, <br>
                which makes them heavier, more complex and less efficient on smooth surfaces.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Gravel</h3>
            <p>Gravel bikes at first glance look very similar to road bikes with their lack of suspension and drop bars.<br>
                Where gravel bikes differ from road bikes is that the bars are usually wider, geometry is adapted to be <br>
                more comfortable riding offroad for long periods of time and modern gravel bikes will also feature a 1x drivetrain.
