    <h1>MTB</h1>
    <p>Mountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough terrain, usually using specially designed mountain bikes. Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain, such as air or coil-sprung shocks used as suspension, larger and wider wheels and tires, stronger frame materials, and mechanically or hydraulically actuated disc brakes.</p>

            <h3>Mountain Bikes</h3>
            <p>Mountain bikes differ from other bikes primarily in that they incorporate features aimed at increasing durability and improving performance in rough terrain.hey also tend to have lower ratio gears to facilitate climbing steep hills and traversing obstacles. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Accessories</h3>
            <p>Glasses with little or no difference from those used in other cycling sports, help protect against debris while on the trail.<br>
                Shoes generally have gripping soles similar to those of hiking boots for scrambling over un-ridable obstacles, unlike the smooth-bottomed shoes used in road cycling. <br>
            </p>

        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Protective gear</h3>
            <p>The level of protection worn by individual riders varies greatly and is affected by speed, trail conditions, the weather, and numerous other factors, including personal choice. Protection becomes more important where these factors may be considered to increase the possibility or severity of a crash. A helmet and gloves are usually regarded as sufficient for the majority of non-technical riding.</p>

            <h3>Cross-country cycling</h3>
            <p>Cross-Country (XC) generally means riding point-to-point or in a loop including climbs and descents on a variety of terrain.Cross country mountain biking focuses on physical strength and endurance more than the other forms, which require greater technical skill. Cross country mountain biking is the only mountain biking discipline in the Summer Olympic Games. </p>

            <h3>All-mountain/Enduro</h3>
            <p>All-mountain/Enduro bikes tend to have moderate-travel suspension systems and components which are stronger than XC models.Historically, many long-distance XC races would use the descriptor "enduro" in their race names to indicate their endurance aspect.Enduro racing includes elements of DH racing, but Enduro races are much longer, sometimes taking a full day to complete.</p>

            <h3>Downhill</h3>
            <p>Downhill (DH) is, in the most general sense, riding mountain bikes downhill. Because of the extremely steep terrain (often located in summer at ski resorts), downhill mountain biking is one of the most extreme and dangerous cycling disciplines. Minimum body protection in a true downhill setting entails wearing knee pads and a full-face helmet with goggles. </p>
